# Cell Number Counting

Algae is cultured until OD value reached 1.2, the cell number is calculated by CASY system.

# mRNA Isolation
	1.	Algae is collected and pelleted by centrifuged (10,000 xg, 3 mins), the supernatant is discared.
	2.	Add in bead beater tubes ~100μl of 0,1mm-beads. Bead beat for 1 min.
	3.	Add 1 ml TRI Reagent into the tube, the pelleted was resuspended quickly and totally, and immediately flash frozen in Liquid Nitrogen.
	4.	Melt sample at 60 degree (not totally, make ice just disappear), and freeze sample using Liquid Nitrogen.
	5.	Melt sample at 60 degree (not totally, make ice just disappear), and freeze sample using Liquid Nitrogen.
	6.	Heat tubes at 60°C, 10 mins. 
	7.	Spin down at 12000 rpm for 10 mins, 4°C, then put the supernatant in a 2 ml clean tube, with 200 μl chloroform, incubating 5 mins at RT’
	8.	Spin down the mixture at 12,000 rpm for 3 min, 4°C
	9.	Take aqueous phases (水样液) (transparent), ~700μl in a 1,5 ml tube
	10.	Add 500 μl 2-propanol, mix by inversion, then incubate 5 mins at RT
	11.	Transfer the sample in a column with clean collection 2 ml tube. Then centrifuge at 10,000 xg for 1 min and discard flow-through.
	12.	Wash the column with 400 ul RB Buffer, discard the flow-through.
	13.	Wash the column with 600 ul RNA Wash buffer, centrifuge at 10,000 xg for 1 min and discard flow-through.
	14.	Wash the column with 600 ul Wash Buffer again. Also discard flow-through.
	15.	Centrifuge the spin at 13,000 xg for 2 min to remove the Wash Buffer, and dry the column.
	16.	Transfer the column into a clean 1.5 ml collection tube, and add 40 ul RNA-Free Water into Column, stand the tube for 1 min, then centrifuge at 10,000 xg for 1 min.
	17.	Measure the OD value with NanoDrop Machine. 

# DNase Treatment (USE DNase Kit)
	1. 2 units DNase (2 ul), 1 ul Reaction Buffer, 7 ul isolated RNA.
	2. Incubate at 37 degree for 30 min.
	3. Add 1 ul stop solution into the Mixture.

# cDNA Step (USE cDNA Kit)
	1. Prepare Mix A: 6 ul RNA, 1 ul Oligo Primer, 1 ul Random Primer.
	2. Prepare Mix B:  
		>>>> For one tube amount
		- RNase Free Water, 3.5 ul
		- GoScript 5x Reaction Buffer, 4 ul
		- MgCl2, 2 ul
		- PCR Nucleotide Mix, 1 ul
		- Ribonuclease inhibitor, 0.5 ul
		- Reverse Transcriptase, 1 ul
	3. Heat Mix A at 70 degree for 5 min, then cold on ice for 8 min.
	4. Mix Mix A and Mix B together, then go to thermo cycler.
	5. - 25 degree, 5 min
	- 42 degree, 1 hour
	- 72 degree, 15 min
	- Cool Down to 4 degree and hold. 

# qPCR Step 
	1. Dilute cDNA product 10 times.
	2. Prepare Master-Master Mix
		>>> For one well amount
		- PCR Master Mix, 10 ul
		- Forward Primer, 0.4 ul
		- Reverse Primer, 0.4 ul
		- Nuclease Free Water, 8.2 ul
	3. Load 19 ul Master-Master Mix into each well.
	4. Load corresponding template 1 ul into each well.
	5. Seal up the plate using adhesive film.
	6. Spin down at 2000 xg for 2 min.
	7. Power on the machine, select Delta-Delta-CT and SYBR Green
	8. Run qPCR Protocol, around 100 min.
