# Matrigel Dilution (Conring #354277)

1. Query Lot number from Corning website, and confirm with dilution factor from Certificate Report.
2. Thaw Matrigel on the ice in 4 degree fridge in advance from -80.
3. Pre-cooling EP tubes, tips (200 ul. 1000 ul).
4. Add one aliquot (Dilution Factor) of Corning Matrigel hESC-qualified Matrix to 25 mL of DMEM/F-12, Repeat pipetting, then store at 4 degree.
5. The Rest of Matrigel shall be aliquoted into 15/50 ml tubes.=, and store at -80.

# bFGF Preparation

1. Pufei Company: http://www.pufei.com/product/info/113890 1106-050 5x10ug
2. Spindown bFGF Powder, add 1 ml ddH2O to dissolve and pass the 0.22um filter as STOCK SOLUTION (10 ug/mL), 2000X, working concentration 5 ng/ml.
3. Aliqoute bFGF to several tube and srore at -20, Light proofed.

# ESC Culture Medium

1. NEAA 100X | Gibco Cat:11140050
2. GlutaMAX 100X | Gibco Cat:35050061
3. KSR 20% | Gibco Cat:10828-028
4. Beta-mercaptoethanol 0.1mM
5. Y27632


# Preparation of Feeder Cells

1. Choose well cultured and grew MEF cells P3, discard culture medium partly and 7 mL medium on the plates (10 cm dish), add Mitomycin C to to a working
    concentration 10 ug/mL, then cells are treated at 37 degree for 2.5-3 hours.
2. Coating the culture plates with diluted Matrigel Mixture (add 1 mL mixture in a 6 cm dish), and incubate at 37 degree at least 30 min.
3. Discard culture medium containing Mitomycin C, wahs the cells with EDTA-PBS twice gently, then cells are digested with 0.25% trypsin solution and 37 degree for 2 min.
    culture medium is added as 1:2 to stop digestion, and pippet cell gently.
4. transfer cells into 15 ml centrifuge tube, spin down at 1200 rpm, 2 min.
5. Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in 2-5 mL culture medium.
6. Cell counting and seed the cell as 1*10^6 per 10 cm dish and culture at 37 degree overnight as Feeder Cells. OR freeze cell as back up.

# hESC recovery culture

1. Remove culture medium of Feeder cells, and wash with PBS gently, then add 1 mL H9 culture medium, and Feeder plate is ready to use, plate ccould be placed at 37 degree before use.
2. Get H9 cells from Liquid Nitrogen and thaw at 37 degree water bath, then 1 mL H9 medium is added into cryo tube and cells is pippet out and transfer into 15 mL tube 
    containing pre-heated 6-8 mL H9 Medium dropwisely.
3. Cells are centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 2 min.
4. Supernatant is discarded, add 1 mL H9 culture medium to resuspend cell wells, containing 1ul 10 mM Y26732.
5. Seeding cells onto dished as planned.
6. Change culture medium next days without containing Y27632, meanwhile contains bFGF (working concentration 5 ng/mL)
