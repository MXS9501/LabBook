# Protein Induction
	1. Pick the target positive colony to 5 mL LB Broth with Antibiotics, grow at 37 degree, with 200 rpm, overnight.
	2. Add 5 ml overnight culture mixture into 500 ml LB Broth medium containing Antibiotics.
	3. Grow the bacteria at 37 degree shaking at 200 rpm for around 3 hours until OD600 reaching 0.8 or a little higher.
	4. Add 5 ul 1 M IPTG into Medium
	5. Grow the bacteria with IPTG for another 1.5 hour.
	6. Collect bacteria via centrifugation for 10 min at 8,500 rpm at 4 degree.
	7. Re-suspend pellet with 10 ml Lysis Buffer, also add Phosphatase and Protease Inhibitor Buffer.
	8. Follow next steps or freeze samples at -80 degree.

# GST-tag/ His-tag Protein Purification

	1. 

# SDS-PAGE

	1. Heat tubes at 95 degree for 15 min.
	2. Mix with Protein loading dye, Beyotime Company.
	3. Load samples onto 10% SDS gel. Make four gels, two for Western Blot, two for Coomassie Blue.
