# Purification of Tagged Protein
	1. Pick the target positive colony to 5 mL LB Broth with Antibiotics, grow at 37 degree, with 200 rpm, overnight.
	2. Add 5 ml overnight culture mixture into 500 ml LB Broth medium containing Antibiotics.
	3. Grow the bacteria at 37 degree shaking at 200 rpm for around 3 hours until OD600 reaching 0.8 or more.
	4. Add 5 ul 1 M IPTG into Medium
	5. Grow the bacteria with IPTG for another 1.5 hour.
	6. Collect bacteria via centrifugation for 10 min at 8,500 rpm at 4 degree.
	7. Resuspend pellet with 10 ml Lysis Buffer, also add Phosphatase and Protease Inhibitor Buffer.
	8. Follow next steps or freeze samples at -80 degree.
	9.
